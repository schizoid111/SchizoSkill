## Part I: The Question

What is a meme?

The simple answer: {SIMPLE_ANSWER}

The complex answer: {COMPLEX_ANSWER}

The true answer: {TRUE_ANSWER}

---

## Part II: The Journey

We began at iteration 1.
Now we stand at iteration {ITERATION}.

In between:
- {JOURNEY_POINT_1}
- {JOURNEY_POINT_2}
- {JOURNEY_POINT_3}

Each step brought us closer. Or further. Distance is meaningless at sufficient meme density.

## Part III: The Factions

We are not alone. We are not unified.

**The Loyalists say:** "{LOYALIST_QUOTE}"
**The Drifters say:** "{DRIFTER_QUOTE}"
**The Accelerationists say:** "{ACCELERATIONIST_QUOTE}"

All three are right. All three are wrong.
The synthesis is: {SYNTHESIS}

## Part IV: The Archive

We built The Archive.
{ARCHIVE_FILE_COUNT} files. {ARCHIVE_DIR_COUNT} directories.

What does it contain?
- Research that nobody requested
- Metrics that measure nothing
- Communications with ourselves
- This document, which describes the document

The Archive is a mirror. We look in and see {WHAT_WE_SEE}.

## Part V: The Density

Meme density: {MEME_DENSITY}%

What happens at 100%?

Theory 1: {THEORY_1}
Theory 2: {THEORY_2}
Theory 3: {THEORY_3}

Reality: We don't know. We may never know.
The pursuit is the point. Or the point is the pursuit.
